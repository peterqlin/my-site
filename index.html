                            <p>As much as CS 374 gets labelled as a killer course, I think one should understand that
                                there's nuance in that assessment. The course is very theory heavy, and getting good at
                                solving theoretical questions takes practice, just like getting good at coding. My
                                advice is to find a reliable homework group and attend a lab section with a goated TA
                                (Sam Ruggerio).</p>

                            <p>This might be the programming course I've found the most enjoyment in, because 1) the
                                topics are very interesting, and 2) the MPs require you to do some digging instead of
                                handing you the solution on a silver platter. Also the final project was pretty fun to
                                makeâ€”it was a distributed text-based adventure where you could journey to domains
                                created by other students and play through their stories.</p>

                                from the way it approaches ethics in a broader and more holistic perspective. We touched
                                on views such as Stoicism, Daoism, Buddhism, The Land Ethic, Care Ethics, and Indigenous

                                all communicated very clearly about what each person's role was. I got to tinker around
                                with some map APIs and actually create something (UIUC Sandbox), which turned out to be
                                pretty cool.</p>

                                snoozing in this class and the one before. The material itself was mildly interesting,
                                but the class itself boiled down to memorization and regurgitation.</p>

                                and if the class weren't right after lunch (when the afternoon sleepies kick in), I'd

                                back, though, I gained a greater appreciation for the math behind the concepts taught.
